# About us

Hi everyone! We are Dev Lab, three Italian guys passionate about computer science. We have a big idea and we ask for your help to realize it.

# The Jukebox and how it works

Jukebox is a software we invented which allows you to choose the music you listen to in pubs, restaurants, cafés and all the places you attend. Just like the old Jukebox! But completely renewed.

The system is made of two elements: the server and the mobile app.

- The server plays music from the playlist or some songs automatically from the database.

- The mobile app allows you to choose, vote, upload and download music from the server.

We also added some chat services which will permit you to meet other people in the place, favoring socialization and sharing among users.

Some of the server’s functionalities can be regulated for not running into licensing issues.

The software will be free, of course. See [License](LICENSE)


# Compiling and Running

The project is managed using maven. Thus, you can use Netbeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ or the terminal as long as you have maven! 

Generally, all you need to do is: `import project from maven` and that is all.

## How to test

Coming soon!

# What is important for Dev Lab

We at Dev Lab believe in hacker ethic and free software, always following some points:

- Collaboration: software is something that should always be available to everyone, freely and openly.

- Sharing: culture and art are fundamental goods that should not be imprisoned by patents or copyright. They should, instead, freely circulate, make progress and help individuals and society to progress as well.

- Technologies and open standards: we want to favor the birth of an ecosystem with open technologies easily customizable basing on need.


# Our aim

We believe that Jukebox will support musical culture and art sharing:

- Allowing to know new bands, songs and genres.

- Socializing with other users in the place.

- Permitting to make yourselves known by publishing and spreading your own songs.

- Actively collaborating to create a musical collection and involve users in creating the atmosphere in the place.
